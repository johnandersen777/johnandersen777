# üê¢ Rolling Alice... ‚è≥

Hello Entity of the Internet! I'm John.

I've fallen down the open source supply chain security rabbit hole.

My current focus is around leveraging threat model and architecture
information to facilitate automated context aware decentralized gamification
/ continuous improvement of the security lifecycle / posture of open source
projects. I would love if you'd join me on this adventure.
